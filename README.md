# Logic Circuits and Computer Architecture Laboratory  

## About the Course  
The Logic Circuits and Computer Architecture Laboratory course is designed to provide hands-on experience with digital logic circuits and computer architecture concepts. The course covers topics such as combinational and sequential logic design, memory systems, processor architecture, and more. The course includes practical projects using both VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) and Verilog, two of the most widely-used hardware description languages.

## Repository Contents  
The repository includes the following:  
- **VHDL and Verilog source code files** for various laboratory experiments.  
- **Documentation** and explanations for each experiment.  
- **Supplementary materials** and resources.

## How to Use  
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
2. Navigate to the specific experiment directory you are interested in.
3. Open the VHDL or Verilog source code file using a VHDL/Verilog simulator or an IDE like ModelSim, Vivado, or VS Code with relevant extensions.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the documentation to run and test the experiment.

## Using VHDL and Verilog with Recommended Tools  
This repository includes examples in both VHDL and Verilog. To work with the code effectively, we recommend using the following tools and extensions:

### Visual Studio Code Extensions  
To work efficiently with both VHDL and Verilog, consider installing the following extensions in VS Code:

#### 1. VHDL Extensions  
- **VHDL Support**  
  - Provides syntax highlighting, linting, and code snippets for VHDL.
  - To install: Open VS Code → Go to Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) → Search for "VHDL Support" → Click "Install".
  
- **VHDL Linter**  
  - Offers error detection, code analysis, and additional features for VHDL.
  - Follow the same installation steps as above, searching for "VHDL Linter".

#### 2. Verilog Extensions  
- **Opendigital js**  
  - Enhances VS Code for digital design and Verilog HDL, offering syntax highlighting, code formatting, and linting.
  - To install: Open VS Code → Go to Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) → Search for "Opendigital js" → Click "Install".

- **Verilog HDL**  
  - Provides support for Verilog with features like syntax highlighting, code snippets, and linting.
  - To install: Follow the same installation steps, searching for "Verilog HDL".

### Simulation and Synthesis Tools  
For simulation and testing of VHDL and Verilog code, we recommend the following tools:

- **ModelSim**  
  - A popular simulator for both VHDL and Verilog, providing a user-friendly interface for compiling and simulating hardware designs.
- **Vivado**  
  - An integrated design environment for VHDL/Verilog and FPGA design, offering simulation, synthesis, and implementation tools.

## Running the Code  
1. Choose the relevant source code file (VHDL or Verilog) for the experiment you wish to work on.
2. Use a VHDL/Verilog-compatible simulator (e.g., ModelSim or Vivado) to compile and simulate the design.
3. Review the simulation results and waveforms to understand the behavior of the digital circuit.
4. Modify the code as necessary to experiment with different configurations and designs.
