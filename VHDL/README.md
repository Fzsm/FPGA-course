### About the Course  
The Logic Circuits and Computer Architecture Laboratory course is designed to provide hands-on experience with digital logic circuits and computer architecture concepts. The course covers topics such as combinational and sequential logic design, memory systems, processor architecture, and more.

### Repository Contents  
The repository includes the following:  
- VHDL source code files for various laboratory experiments.  
- Documentation and explanations for each experiment.  
- Supplementary materials and resources.

### How to Use  
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
2. Navigate to the specific experiment directory you are interested in.
3. Open the VHDL source code file using a VHDL simulator or an IDE like ModelSim or Vivado.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the documentation to run and test the experiment.

### Using VHDL and Recommended Tools  
This repository includes VHDL code examples for logic circuits and computer architecture experiments. To work with the code effectively, we recommend using the following tools and extensions in the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor:

#### 1. VHDL Extensions for VS Code  
These extensions provide a variety of features to help you work efficiently with VHDL code.

- **VHDL Support**  
  The VHDL Support extension provides syntax highlighting, linting, and code snippets for VHDL. To install the extension, follow these steps:
  
  1. Open VS Code.
  2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the left sidebar or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
  3. Search for "VHDL Support" in the Extensions Marketplace.
  4. Click on the "Install" button.

- **VHDL Linter**  
  The VHDL Linter extension checks for syntax errors, warnings, and provides other helpful feedback. To install the extension, follow the same steps as above, searching for "VHDL Linter".

#### 2. ModelSim or Vivado  
For simulation and testing of VHDL code, we recommend using tools such as **ModelSim** or **Vivado**:
- **ModelSim** is a popular simulator for both VHDL and Verilog, providing a user-friendly interface for compiling and simulating VHDL designs.
- **Vivado** is another powerful tool that integrates with VHDL and FPGA design workflows. It offers synthesis, simulation, and implementation tools.
